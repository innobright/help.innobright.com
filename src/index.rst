Welcome to Innobright's documentation & help portal!
====================================================

Innobright's Altus is the world's first multi-platform, Monte Carlo render denoising system. We let you generate fast, noisy renders with smaller samples per pixel (SPP) and filter them to produce high quality images & animation. We give you the quality you want, in a fraction of the time.

On this site, you can find out information about Altus, like it's latest changes, how Altus works, and how to use it in your visual effects (VFX) pipeline with your favorite software.
