SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

1. Parties. The parties to this Agreement are you, the licensee ("You", “Yourself” or “Your”), and Innobright. If You are not acting on behalf of Yourself as an individual, then "You" means Your company or organization.

2. The Software. The software licensed under this Agreement consists of computer programs in compiled, object code form, data compilation(s), and related documentation referred to as Innobright’s “Altus” software (collectively, the "Software"), which is intended for use in computer animation rendering acceleration and “denoising”, image enhancement and related applications. The term “Software” as used herein refers to any version of the Altus software. In addition, in the absence of a written agreement to the contrary, this Agreement will govern Your use of, and the term “Software” will include, any other software application used by You that was developed by Innobright and made available to its users.

3. Evaluation Version License Grant. If You have downloaded or otherwise received an evaluation version of the Software, You are authorized to use the Software on a limited, royalty-free, nontransferable, non-sublicensable basis for whatever period of time is specified by Innobright at the time such evaluation version is made available to You, and You may use such evaluation version solely for evaluation purposes. You are not permitted to use an evaluation version of the Software for any other purpose or to use such version beyond the applicable evaluation period. Innobright reserves the right to disable any evaluation version of the Software at the expiration of the evaluation period and/or to cause any images, animations or videos rendered using an evaluation version of the Software during or after the evaluation period to contain a digital watermark (the “Watermark”) displaying Innobright’s logo or a similar marking. You may not remove or attempt to remove the Watermark on any such image or video at any time except in connection with your purchase of a registered version (as defined below).

4. Registered Versions of the Software. You may purchase one or more full use versions of the Software (each, a “registered version”) at www.innobright.com for the applicable license fees and for the applicable license term specified at such website (or related web pages) at the time of purchase. Any user of a registered version is referred to herein as a “registered user”. Images, animations or videos rendered in connection with the use of a registered version of the Software will not contain a Watermark. If you have purchased a registered version of the Software, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive license to use the Software for the term specified at the time of purchase (with optional renewal terms) on the additional terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, unless prior to renewal this license is terminated by either party for material breach. Renewal procedures will be provided to registered users prior to the expiration of the initial term, and unless such procedures are strictly satisfied, including the payment of any required license fee, use of the registered version of the Software for any purpose after the expiration of the initial term is not authorized. Upon expiration of the initial subscription term, the Software may automatically disable itself. Immediately upon expiration or termination of this license for any reason, You shall return to Innobright all copies of the Software and documentation.

5. Types of Licenses. The Software may be available for purchase on a “node-locked” or “floating” basis. A “node-locked” (or similarly described) license for the Software means that such version of the Software may be used in accordance with either one of the following authorized uses, but not both: (i) by a single person who uses the Software only on one computer or workstation, or (ii) as installed on any single computer or workstation, provided the single computer or workstation is not used simultaneously by multiple persons. A “floating” (or similarly described) license for the Software means that the Software may be used only in accordance with the following authorized uses: You may install and use the Software on multiple computers, workstations or machines that are connected over Your internal computer network, provided that, at any given time, for each floating license that You have purchased and which remains in effect at such time, only one instance of the Software may be running or otherwise in use on any computer, workstation or machine on such network. For example, if Your organization has an internal network with twenty workstations and You have purchased ten floating licenses for the Software which remain in effect, you may install the Software on all twenty workstations but you may only use the Software on ten workstations at any given time. Use of the Software is subject to further restrictions as set forth below.

6. Archival Copies. When you purchase a registered version of the Software, You may copy the Software for archival purposes, provided that (i) any copy must contain the original Software's proprietary notices in unaltered form, (ii) You may not use any archived copy of the Software unless You have paid all applicable license fees and a license subscription for the Software is then in effect and (iii) You must delete any archived copy of the Software at the end of the applicable license term.

7. Restrictions. You may not: (i) permit others to use the Software, except as expressly provided above for authorized network use for which the appropriate number of floating licenses for the Software have been purchased; (ii) modify or translate the Software; (iii) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except to the extent this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law; (iv) create derivative works based on the Software; (v) merge the Software with another product; (vi) copy the Software, except as expressly provided above; (vii) remove or obscure any proprietary rights notices or labels on the Software; or (viii) use the Software in any manner other than its intended use as described at www.innobright.com or in any other written materials posted or otherwise made available to licensees by Innobright from time to time regarding the Software

8. SPECIAL RESTRICTION ON USE. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event may any instance of the Software be used as a standalone denoiser to accept and process render outputs from multiple workstations or servers not originating on the workstation or server on which the instance of the Software is installed. Use of any instance of the Software as a “processing node” in the production pipeline in such a manner as to cause such instance of the Software to accept and process multiple render outputs simultaneously is strictly prohibited. If Innobright in its sole discretion determines or suspects that the Software is being or has been used in violation of this Agreement in any respect, it shall notify the applicable licensee of the actual or suspected violation and, if the violation is not corrected or cured to the satisfaction of Innobright within 10 days of notice, then Innobright  may, in addition to enforcing or pursuing any other rights or remedies then available it, immediately terminate the applicable license subscription.

9. Transfers Prohibited. This Agreement is personal to You. You are prohibited from selling, loaning, renting, leasing, sublicensing, transmitting, distributing or redistributing, or otherwise transferring or assigning any part of the Software or the accompanying documentation to any third party at any time whether by operation of law or otherwise and whether with or without consideration. Without limiting the foregoing, any transmittal or transfer of the Software or the accompanying documentation on the Internet or by other electronic means is prohibited. ANY REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOFTWARE OR THE ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED BY LAW AND MAY SUBJECT YOU TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES. ANY ACTUAL OR ATTEMPTED SALE, LOAN, RENTAL, LEASE, SUBLICENSE, TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION OR REDISTRIBUTION OR OTHER TRANSFER OR ASSIGNMENT OF THE SOFTWARE OR THE DOCUMENTATION IN WHOLE OR IN PART IN ANY MEDIA OR BY ANY METHOD SHALL IMMEDIATELY AND IRREVOCABLY TERMINATE THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR ALL PURPOSES.

12. Local Law. If implied warranties may not be disclaimed under applicable law, then ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE PERIOD REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply to You. This warranty gives you specific rights, and You may have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

13. Limitation of Liability. INDEPENDENT OF THE FORGOING PROVISIONS, IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, OR STRICT PRODUCTS LIABILITY, SHALL INNOBRIGHT OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER MALFUNCTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF COMMERCIAL DAMAGE, EVEN IF INNOBRIGHT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. IN NO EVENT SHALL INNOBRIGHT'S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE LICENSE.
