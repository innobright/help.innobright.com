Using an existing RLM licensing server
--------------------------------------

If you already have an RLM license server up and running, itâ€™s easy to add your Altus Denoiser product licenses to that server. 

Download the Innobright RLM package below and extract the innobright.set and innobright.opt files.  Then copy them to your RLM folder on the license server. Then do a reread/restart of the server to pick up the added licenses.

Download the license server package for `Windows`__, `Mac`__, or `Linux`__.
