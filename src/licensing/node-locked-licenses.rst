Node-locked licenses
--------------------

Node-locked RLM licenses are not supported by Innobright.

To license Altus, you must run an RLM server on the same computer running Altus or elsewhere on your network.

In the past, we have offered node-locked licenses; they caused IT headaches for both customers and Innobright alike, so we've permanently discontinued offering them.
