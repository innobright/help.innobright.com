What is Altus?
--------------

Innobright’s Altus is the world’s first multi-platform, Monte Carlo render denoising system. We let you generate fast, noisy renders with smaller samples per pixel (SPP) and filter them to produce high quality images & animation. We give you the quality you want, in a fraction of the time.
