GUI
===

At this time, the Altus' Graphical User Interface (GUI) is only available for Windows.

The GUI is for those who have trouble with using the Altus command line. Generally, we recommend that if you can use the command line directly, you use that instead.

The first time you use the GUI it will open the License Wizard which will gather basic information like your innobright.com username and whether you plan to register Altus with a license or evaluate the product first.

To use Altus, fill in the image input boxes with their respective image paths and click run.
You can add more input boxes by clicking Add AOV and selecting the type of AOV.
If you are unsure about the AOV type then select 'extra'
You can drag and drop your files into the file boxes, type in your paths, or copy paste from one box to another.
You can import config files into the GUI.  Drag and drop the config file over the top header bar to import or click the 'import' button

The GUI has some additional features:
 * A realtime log can be viewed on the right side of the program if the 'Display Log in GUI' is checked (turned on by default)
 * Side-by-Side processing (also known as stereo imagery, generated from a single seed)
 * Layered EXR processing (when enabled, a choose layer button will allow layer selection)
 * Extra feature processing (pass extra inputs for improved feature detection and denoised result)
 * Import and export functionality for config files (Only support config files from Altus 1.6+)
 * GUI reset

The GUI can select to use CPU only, run on an auto-selected GPU based on memory size, or manually select which compute device to use.  These options are in the settings window.

The GUI can show your current license status in the top right corner.  A green light means your license is valid.

The GUI can set filter quality levels, preserve layers, and output prefiltered, preview or production filtered AOVs.
